#  Markets and Economics

## Mixed Economy: Public Sector& Private Sector

### Public sector:

* Government is known as **public sector**

* Businesses that are privately owned make up the **private sector**

* Private sector: **break even** or **make a profit** to survive

* **Most** countries have a mixed economy -- there are **no** purely free market economies

* In a **pure free market economy** there would be **no public sector**

* In a **pure command economy** there would be **no private sector**

### Influential Economic Thinkers: Smith, Mark and Hayek

**Adam Smith**

* Invisible hand

* self-interest: maximize own profits

**Karl Marks**

* critical of the free market

* rise of communism

**Friedrich Hayek**

* support of free market system

* Individual has best knowledge


## Economic Objectives

### The Concept of Margin

* **Margin** is the **change** in a variable caused by and **increase of one unit** of another variable

* **Marginal cost**: the **additional cost** of making **one additional product**

  > 100 ice-cream: $100
  >
  > 101 ice-cream: $102
  >
  > the **marginal cost** of the 101th ice-cream: $2

### Economics Agents: Utility Maximisers

1. **Traditional economic theory assumes** that economic agents (e.g. producers, consumers and workers) want to maximise their **utility**

2. **Different ways** of maximising utility (e.g. happiness, profit)

3. Economic agent are **rational**: based **solely** on maximising utility and **nothing else**

  #### How Consumers act Rationally

  1. **marginal utility**, **total utility** and the **law of diminishing marginal utility**
     * Marginal utility
     * Total utility: the **overall benefits**
     * law of diminishing marginal utility: for **each additional unit** of a good that's consumed, the **marginal utility** gained **decreases**. **Less satisfaction** than previous one

  2. **Rational consumer** will choose when **marginal utility = price**
  3. **Demand curve slopes downwards**

### Different Economic Agent have different Economic Objectives

#### Producers:

> 1. A firm's **profit** is their **total revenue** minus **total cost**
> 2. Firms are traditionally assumed to maximise **profits** for **various** reasons:
>    * **Survive**
>    * **Better rewards** to the **owner** and **staff**
>    * **reinvested** into the business in order to **expand**
>
> 3. Firms may want to maximise other quantities instead, such as **total sales** or **market share**
>    * A large market share -> lead to **monopoly power**
>    * Bigger firms -> **prestigious** or **stable** -> attract employees
>
> 4. **Ethical Objectives** -- i.e. 'doing some good', even if it **doesn't** increase profits

#### Consumers:

> 1. Consumers are assumed to want to **maximise their utility**
>    * **Utility** involves different things for different people
>    * act **rationally**
> 2. When act as workers -- **workers** are assumed to want to **maximise** their **income**, while having as mush **free time** as they need

#### Governments:

> 1. Try to balance the **resource** of a country with the **needs and wants** of the population: **maximise the 'public utility'**
> 2. This include:
>    * **Economic growth** - measured by **GDP**
>    * **Full employment**
>    * **Equilibrium in the balance of payments** - a balanced payment **into** and **out of** the country
>    * **Low inflation** - high inflation can cause serious problem
> 3. **Competing objectives** - achieve one objective can make it **more difficult** to achieve another



# Behavioural Economics

### Behavioural Economics Challenges traditional economic theory

1. In **traditional economic theory**:
   * Utility Maximiser
   * Rational
2. Behavioural challenges assumptions: **not realistic**
3. Behavioural **doesn't ignore** traditional economic: **make it more relevant to real world**

### Rationality is used to explain actions of Economic Agent

### Consumers Don't act Rationally

1. Lots of **restrictions**:
   * time is **limited**
   * Not all information is **available** and information may be **incorrect**
   * People may not be able to **process and evaluate the vast amount of data** (**computation weakness**)
2. These **limits** are known as **'boundary rationality'**

### Bias

individuals are influenced by **biases**

>* **Rules of Thumb** - simple useful tools that help individual to decide, e.g. **middle-priced option**
>* **Anchoring** - placing **too much emphasis** on **one piece of information**
>* **Availability bias** - judgement are based on the **probability** of events occurring based on how **easy** it is to **remember** such events occurring (e.g. **overestimation**)
>* **Social norms** - decision base on **social group**
>* 
>

#### Fairness can influence decision
